            <h1>Donatello, the purple-masked Ninja Turtle, and his journey of resilience.</h1>
            <p>In his teenage years, Donatello met Leo, a young human engineer he encountered at an underground tech meetup. They connected over inventions, spending late nights troubleshooting circuits and exploring the city’s empty backstreets. 
                For Donatello, it was more than friendship—Leo made him feel seen in a way he’d never experienced before. Their bond grew, and one night, sitting on the edge of the Turtle Van, 
                Donatello felt an unexpected warmth as Leo's gaze lingered on his.
                Their connection couldn’t last, bound by their separate worlds. But in those brief, hidden moments, Donatello found strength in his own identity. Though they eventually went separate ways,
                 Donatello kept Leo's memory close, knowing it had shaped his journey to self-acceptance and the courage he carried with him every day.</p>
